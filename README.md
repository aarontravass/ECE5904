# ECE5904

If you want to run the full stack, simply run `docker-compose up` 
and then open `localhost:80` to view the web app

If you only want the server, run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-server.yml up`

There is a prebuilt frontend image available at https://hub.docker.com/r/outerspace1920/ece5904-fe/
